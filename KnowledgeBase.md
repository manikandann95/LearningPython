    The purpose of the def() keyword is to define a new function. 

    Best practices for writing code that is readable and reusable:

        Create a reusable function - Replace duplicate code with one reusable function to make the code easier to read and repurpose.

        Refactor code - Update code so that it is self-documenting and the intent of the code is clear.

        Add comments # - Adding comments is part of creating self-documenting code. 
        Using comments allows you to leave notes to yourself and/or other programmers to make the purpose of the code clear.
